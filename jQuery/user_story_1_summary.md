# Code Summary â€“ User Story 1: Greeting & Farewell

## Purpose
This script enables basic user interaction by providing a chatbot that returns a greeting and a farewell message.

## Files Created
- **main.py**: Entry point. Imports and runs the chatbot.
- **chatbot.py**: Contains `get_greeting()` and `get_farewell()` functions used in the chatbot.
- **.gitignore**: Filters out virtual environment files and other unnecessary clutter.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies (currently none).

## How It Works
- The `main()` function in `main.py` calls both the greeting and farewell functions from `chatbot.py`.
- `chatbot.py` simply returns two hardcoded strings.
- Output is printed to the terminal upon running `main.py`.

## Why this matters
This establishes the skeleton of the chatbot and shows how user stories are translated into Python functions and a running script.
