    <u><h1>Woodchuck Riddle</h1></u>

    <p>
      Ah...the classic quandry of woodchucks huffing and chucking! Was it only
      me who grew up as a child confusing them with beavers because of this? You
      can understand then, how it was such a surprise when I learned about the
      humorous scientific twist to this tail-oops-I mean tale. You see,
      woodchucks are known for burrowning, so they actually chuck dirt instead!
      That's right, you read correctly. Woodchucks are known for their burrowing
      capabilities! Which brings us to our updated riddle:
    </p>

    <h3>On average, how much muck can a woodchuck huck per burrow?</h3>
    <!-- Unordered list answers to choose from -->
    <ul>
      <li>327 lbs</li>
      <li>500 lbs</li>
      <li>111 lbs</li>
      <li>700 lbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Type your answer below!</h3>

    <!-- Input box created to accept users answer -->
    <input id="dirt_In" type="text" placeholder="Type exactly: *** lbs" />

    <!-- <button> element with the onclick element 'dirt_Chuck()' to trigger the function -->
    <button onclick="dirt_Chuck()">Submit</button>

    <!-- <p> element with the id attribute 'result' to ouput user result -->
    <p id="dirt_Out"></p>

    <!-- DOCUMENT.GETELEMENTSBYCLASSNAME() METHOD -->

    <!-- Created two <elements with the id attributes 'horse' -->
    <h1>Horses usually neigh, but...</h1>
    <p class="horse">"Say 'neigh' horse", said the man.</p>
    <p class="horse">Neigh?!</p>
    <!-- Created a button element with an onclick attribute 'mr_Ed' -->
    <button onclick="mr_Ed()">Click for Talking Horse</button>
